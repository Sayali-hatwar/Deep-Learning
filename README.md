# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns and representations in large datasets.
## ANN
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process and learn from data. ANNs are widely used in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics by learning patterns and making decisions from input data. They are the foundation of deep learning models, where multiple layers help in capturing intricate patterns.
